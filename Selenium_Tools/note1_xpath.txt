1) Difference between single ‘/’ or double ‘//’

A single slash at the start of Xpath instructs XPath engine to look for element starting from root node.
A double slash at the start of Xpath instructs XPath engine to search look for matching element anywhere in the XML document.

2) Relative XPath - Combination of Double Slash 

Relative xpath can be choose in many ways and to understand that, it is required to understand the usage of single & double slashes in the xpaths.

Usage of Single ‘/’ and double ‘//’ in the xpath :

A single slash ‘/’ anywhere in Xpath signifies to look for the element immediately inside its parent element.
A double slash ‘//’ signifies to look for any child or any grand-child element inside the parent element.

Finding it confusing, just look at the xpath of the same RSS button with using double slashes in the middle of the xpath:

Absolute xpath: /html/body/div[2]/div/div/footer/section[3]/div/ul/li[3]/a
FirePath xpath: //*[@id=’social-media’]/ul/li[3]/a

New relative xpath: //body//footer/section[3]/div/ul/li[3]/a
Another relative xpath: //body//section[3]/div/ul/li[3]/a

3) Partial XPath - Contains Keyword

Most of the times tester face issues when the locator’s properties are dynamically generating. 
Let’s take the example of my profile image on this same page at the right side of the screen and assume that the ‘src’ of 
the image  is dynamically generating. 

The html code of the div looks like this:

XHTML

<div class="profile_cont" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" itemscope="">
<img src="https://toolsqa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Profile.jpg?51a507" itemprop="image">
</div>

The only thing we are sure here is that the text ‘Profile’ will always be included in the src of this image, 
so we can utilize this hint in our xpath like this:   //img[contains(@src,’Profile’)]

4) Partial XPath - Starts-With Keyword

Now let’s take another example of the Linked In image on this same page at the right side of the screen just under the My 
Profile section and again assume that the ‘src’ of the image  is dynamically generating. 

The html code of the div looks like this:

XHTML

<img alt="Visit Us On Linkedin" style="border:0px;" src="http://toolsqa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/linkedin.png">

The only thing we are sure here is that the text ‘Visit Us On Linkedin’ will always be included in the ‘src’ of this image, 
so we can utilize this hint in our xpath like this:    //img[starts-with(@alt,’Visit Us On Linkedin’)]

5) Partial XPath - Text Keyword

Take another example of the text of my name “Lakshay Sharma’ on this same page at the right side of the screen just under 
the My Profile section. 

The html code of the div looks like this:

XHTML

<span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
<b itemprop="name">LAKSHAY SHARMA</b>
. I’M A
<b>TEST AUTOMATION ENGINEER</b>
</span>

-- //*[text()='LAKSHAY SHARMA']

Other examples :

Below the image, you can see link with words/sentences = 'View my complete profile'

-- //*[text()='View my complete profile']

OR

-- //a[contains (text(), 'View my complete profile')]
