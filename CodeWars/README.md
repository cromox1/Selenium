## Codewars: Train with Programming Challenges/Kata

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as *kata*. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online IDE.

Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on *kata* in the dojo and reach your highest potential.

Codewars was founded by Jake Hoffner and Nathan Doctor in November 2012. The company has raised over $1 million in funding from a range of investors in the technology space, including Cornerstone OnDemand Inc., venture capital fund Venture51, Paige Craig and Brian Lee.
